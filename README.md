## Key Features

* **Kotlin** - It is a language that is being widely used in microservices and in certain backend applications and is highlighted for its security
  - Language that I'm really enjoying and being able to use it both in the backend and in the Mobile area ends up not only making it easier to use just one language, but also to learn even more about Kotlin.
* Simple tic-tac-toe application between two players;
* You can play online;
